My attempt to make a repository to keep track of my dotfiles.

Set up this environment, run `source cfg-install.sh` from your `$HOME` directory.

I tried to implement the strategy described in the following links:

## Install with curl

To install this environment with `curl` run, the following command:

```
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biniona/dotfiles/main/cfg-install.sh | /bin/bash
```
